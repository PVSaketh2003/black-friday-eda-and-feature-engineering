EDA AND FEATURE ENGINEERING - 

This process involves - 
1)data gathering
2)importing libraries and dataset 
3)merge both train and test dataset for performing EDA and feature engineering
4)Handling missing values
5)handling categorical columns and converting to integer as machine understands integer values and trimming the data.
6)Perform data preprocessing and data analysis and then based upon this perform feature scaling which involves standard Scaler .
